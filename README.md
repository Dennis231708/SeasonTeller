# SeasonTeller
 My first react application, once it is ran it will ask the user for their current location then determine whether or not the user lives in the northern or southern hemisphere and if it is summer or winter based on the current month.  The application will then return a specific render with text and icons based on the users current season.  To run the application open the folder in the terminal and then use 'npm start' to run the application.
